- Hi, my name is Johannes.
- I’m interested in electronics, AVR microcontrollers, and PC programming, especially at a lower, rather hardware-oriented abstraction level.
- Currently, I’m learning AVR programming in assembly language.
- I look forward to learn C++ programming for desktop and mobile devices, and a bit of C#/.NET for Windows, too.
- I’d also like to work on programming the RP2040 microcontroller in C in the future.
